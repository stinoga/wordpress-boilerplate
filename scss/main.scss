// IMPORTING STYLES ============================================================

// Setup our custom awesome type
@import "lib/type";

// Site Variables
@import "lib/variables";

// Utility modules
@import "lib/normalize",
        "lib/grid";

// Base styles are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.
@import "base";

// Layout and state styling global to the site

// Layout styles divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.

// State styles are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. These are usually applied with javascript
@import "layout";

// Module styles are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.
// TODO: We may want to call these inline via @import and a build script in the future. This will provide the ability to call this css only when needed without an additional request.
@import "modules/nav",
        "modules/footer";

// Print styles
@media print {
  @import "utilities/print";
}
