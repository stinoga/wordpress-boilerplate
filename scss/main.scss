// IMPORTING STYLES ============================================================

// Setup our custom awesome type
@import 'utilities/type';

// Site Variables
@import 'variables';

// Utility modules
@import 'utilities/normalize',
        'utilities/grid';

// Base styles are the defaults. They are almost exclusively single element selectors but it could include attribute selectors, pseudo-class selectors, child selectors or sibling selectors. Essentially, a base style says that wherever this element is on the page, it should look like this.
@import 'base';

// Module styles are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the callouts, the sidebar sections, the product lists and so on.
// TODO: We may want to call these inline via @import and a build script in the future. This will provide the ability to call this css only when needed without an additional request.
@import 'modules/nav',
        'modules/footer';

// Layout styles divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.
@import 'layout';

// State styles are ways to describe how our modules or layouts will look when in a particular state. These are usually applied with javascript
@import 'state';

// Print styles
@media print {
  @import 'utilities/print';
}
